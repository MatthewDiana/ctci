I would design a system to serve up the stock data through HTTP to a web interface. This would allow the client
to access the data on (basically) any machine. It would also scale well as the number of clients uses the system
increases. Perhaps the front-end would also provide options to export the data to CSV, JSON, XML, raw text, or other
formats. Another option to consider is to cache the more frequently queried stocks for faster lookup in the backend.
Our backend could also provide a web API that the clients can use to implement their our applications with the data.
Using the web interface instead of just providing direct access to our database also provides an extra level of
security.
